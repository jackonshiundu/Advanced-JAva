//The Stream API in Java is a feature that allows you to process sequences of elements (such as collections) in a functional style, enabling operations like filtering, mapping, and reducing in a concise and readable way.

import java.util.Arrays;
import java.util.List;

public class StreamAPI {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        //We are creating a list using List Interface
        List<Integer> nums= Arrays.asList(3,76,89,8,47,4);

        //given such a list we have diffrent ways we vcan iterate that list we can use a for loop or enhanced for loop.
        //another way we can iterate is by use of methods provided by Stream API to iterate and do diffrent types of manipulation to the array.
